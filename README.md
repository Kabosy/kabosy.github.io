## Write my life

Moved to the United States at the age of 6 where I went to a French International School in Washington D.C. for the first 4 years than to the American educational system for 2 years. I moved back to France for 2 years than moved to Brussels where I finished my high school and obtained the European Baccalaureate.
I am fully bilingual in English and French and I also studied Spanish for 7 years in school which gives me common knowledge of the language.

Since I loved chemistry in high school, after graduating, I decided to study chemistry and biology in a path called “Bio-ingénieurs” at the Université Catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve in Belgium. Realising that biology wasn’t my thing after failing my first year, I took part in a reorientation course that lasted a month where the goal was to find what you would like to do in life but also find who you are as a person in a more personal level. Thinking about it, I can say that it changed my life.

Having always been close to computers via video games and having two older brothers, I never realised that computer science could be an avenue for a future career. So, I decided to choose this path ! And, today, I don’t regret it.
My whole education was done at the University of Lille in France.

I passed a 2-year degree at the IUT A in Computer Science. There, I learned the basics of coding in Java and C mostly. What I leanred was fascinating and really made me feel that I made the right choice. I had courses in SQL, COBOL, Haskell, C# for Unity, bash, JavaScript and a little bit of Python for mathematical applications. These two years were very complete and gave me an overview of which path could suit me best.
Afterwards, I completed a Bachelor’s degree in computer science where I comfirmed the skills gained in the first two years.
Then came the moment to choose which Master’s to study. Ever since middle school, I have always enjoyed mathematics. I am also extremely curious about artificial intelligence in general and when I saw that they opened up a specialisation in Machine Learning that mixes AI and Math, I jumped to the occasion and was accepted in one of the 12 spots that was available.
