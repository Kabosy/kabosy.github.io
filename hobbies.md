#### Video games :video_game:
Ever since Pokemon Ruby in 2004, I have always been passionate about video games.  
Today I seriously play Rocket League since 2019 and am now ranked Grand Champion 2 which corresponds to the top 0.5% of players playing in ranked mode. I strongly believe that the game improved my decision making skills since the sliver of hesitation can lead to a goal for the enemy team.  
I also love to play solo games such as the Assassin's Creed series, Subnautica, Stardew Valley and Factorio.  

#### CodinGame :computer:
To enhance my coding skills, since I lacked the experience in my pre-academic life, I frequently go back to CodinGame, a website for solving problems. I did a lot of Clash of Code, a mode where a puzzle is given under a certain constraint. Either you have to give the answer the fastest, code it the shortest way possible (Code Golf) or you only get the input and output and have to determine what is asked. All three modes improve specific aspects of coding : reactiveness, optimisation and logical prowess.  

#### Manga :books:
I have been an avid manga reader ever since a dear friend of mine introduced them to me five years ago. My all time favorites are 20th Century Boys by Naoki Urasawa and Goodnight Punpun by Inio Asano. I vastly prefer seinen mangas as they treat more down-to-earth themes. Horror and thrillers are genres that tingle my fancy especially when it is written by the manga horror master Junji Ito. I'd have to say my favorite work form him would be Uzumaki as it brings horror to something that should never be considered scary : the shape of spirals.
